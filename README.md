# ü§ñ Human-in-the-Loop AI Agent (Frontdesk AI)

At Frontdesk, we are building AI receptionists that can manage customer relationships end-to-end.  
This project is a **prototype human-in-the-loop system**: when the AI agent doesn‚Äôt know an answer, it escalates to a human supervisor, learns the answer, and updates its knowledge base.

---

## üéØ Goals
- Build a small system where:
    - AI answers known questions from its **Knowledge Base**.
    - Unknown questions become **Help Requests** (PENDING).
    - A supervisor resolves them, marking them **RESOLVED** or **UNRESOLVED**.
    - Resolved answers are automatically saved back into the Knowledge Base.
- Keep the UI **simple and admin-friendly**.

---

## üõ† Tech Stack
- **Java 17**
- **Spring Boot** (Web, JPA, Thymeleaf, Scheduling)
- **H2 Database** (in-memory for fast testing)
- **Bootstrap 5** (for quick responsive UI)

---

## üöÄ Features
- **Ask AI (Home page):**
    - If the question is known ‚Üí immediate AI answer.
    - If unknown ‚Üí escalated to supervisor with `"Let me check with my supervisor..."`.

- **Help Requests (/requests):**
    - See all **Pending, Resolved, Unresolved** requests.
    - Resolve a request by entering an answer.
    - Lifecycle: `PENDING ‚Üí RESOLVED` or auto-timeout to `UNRESOLVED`.

- **Knowledge Base (/knowledge):**
    - List of all learned Q&A pairs.
    - Pre-seeded with a few FAQs.
    - Expands automatically as supervisors resolve new requests.

- **Lifecycle Management:**
    - Automatic timeout ‚Üí unresolved after **2 minutes** (configurable).
    - `customerId = "caller-web-guest"` simulates the caller identity.
    - Immediate ‚ÄúAI follow-up‚Äù simulated via console logs.

- **Voice Integration (Stub):**
    - Endpoint `POST /voice/transcript` allows simulated integration with LiveKit/Twilio.
    - Accepts `{ callerId, transcript }` and responds with `{ reply }`.
